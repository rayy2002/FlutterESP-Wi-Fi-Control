# ‚ú® Description

This project creates a server on ESP32 and have sets of API commands which are used to control wifi, this commands are fired by using an flutter application connected to the access point of ESP. Features of this projetcs are to turn on and turn on wifi (Turning on wifi actually disconnects the esp from the station does not actually turns on ESP's wifi because the esp needs to restart for that which will eventually loose the Access Point Connection) , Scan for avaliable networks and change Wifi Station from one to another.

## üí° The Bigger Picture

The bigger picture behind this project goes beyond just Wi-Fi control. While currently focusing on managing Wi-Fi connections with an ESP32 and a Flutter app, the idea is much broader. We can imagine extending this control to Bluetooth, TCP, UART, and other user defined functions with the ESP32 microcontroller.

Think about having an Android app that can handle various functions and communication protocols with your ESP32 device. So, while our project may seem small now, the ultimate goal is to create something flexible and powerful that could be used in a wide range of situations.
